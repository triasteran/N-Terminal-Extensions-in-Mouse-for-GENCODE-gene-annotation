# N-Terminal-Extensions-in-Mouse-for-GENCODE-gene-annotation

Here I host scripts for detection of non-AUG/AUG N-terminal extensions in mouse for GENCODE gene annotation during my placement in EMBL-EBI, Hinxton (3rd Oct - 22nd Dec, 2022).

- jupyter notebooks with extracting sequences of extensions, their coordinates, predicted translations and PhyloCSF score
- PhyloCSF scipts 
- final set of ranked extensions ready for manual evaluation
