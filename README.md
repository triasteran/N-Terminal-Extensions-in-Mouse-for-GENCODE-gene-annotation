# N-Terminal-Extensions-in-Mouse-for-GENCODE-gene-annotation

Here I host scripts for detection of non-AUG/AUG N-terminal extensions in mouse for GENCODE gene annotatio during my placement in EMBL-EBI, Hinxton. 

(1) jupyter notebook with extracting sequences of extensions, their coordinates and predicted translations 
(2) PhyloCSF scipts 
(3) final set of ranked extensions ready for manual evaluation
